                <p class="text-justify">Bullet Hell is a 2D, 1v1 platformer shooter. The aim of the game is for players to test their skills in a local multiplayer environment, where one player uses a keyboard and mouse and the other player uses a connected gamepad for control. The game is designed in a pixelart style, with all visual elements created by a member of the development team, ensuring a consistent and unique look.</p>
                <p>The gameplay focuses on quick reflexes and tactical thinking. Players have a wide arsenal of weapons to choose from, including both melee (e.g. katana, scythe, knife) and ranged (e.g. pistol, musket, shotgun, kunai). Apart from basic movement options (left and right, jumping, ladder climbing), there are no special abilities, so players must rely solely on the effective use of weapons and the opportunities provided by the maps.</p>
