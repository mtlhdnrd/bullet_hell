there is/should be a game called Bullet Hell, in which you very violently murder your best friend in a local multiplayer platformer game.
i am trying new things here for further refinement in the live version elsewhere.
this is my first game, presumably my last one too, so no promises on "does it work" or "won't it explode my machine"
most of the time it doesn't work btw, so there's that.
