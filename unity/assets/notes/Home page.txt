INSPIRATIONS
LORN's discography and music video for Weigh Me Down - the slaughterhouse, and the overall industrial, bleak aesthetics
Hotline Miami - pixelart, violence, adrenaline, directness towards player
Tekken - Split-screen, local co-op, fighting game
Drifters - Nobunaga's character and castle
Warframe - for the idea of over-the-top weapons and a bit of parkour implementation, and the high-and-mighty tone
